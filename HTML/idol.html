<h2>Early life and education</h2>
<p>   Born into a musical family on 27 November 1988 in Yangon, Raymond was a son of Saw Khu Hser, a songwriter, and Khin Myat Mon, a singer and vocal trainer. His parents divorced when he was one year old. His mother married again and had a daughter named Lapyae Gabyar, who is also a singer. He went to Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon.
<br><br>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Raymond started his music career in 2002, singing in harmony. In 2005, he co-founded Idiots, a rock band, together with Aung Ye, Phoe Lone and Kyaw Khine, and the band released several songs and mix-tapes.
Under the name of SIR Rock House, Idiots collaborated with other rock bands to release albums and performed music concerts at various locations throughout the region.

    In 2011, Idiots released their first album "Lu Ah Gita". It was followed by the nationwide distributed second album "Khit Thit Kyaut" which was released in July 2016. The album achieved considerable success and established him as a popular singer in the Burmese music scene.[11] The album became one of the best-selling albums in the Myanmar Music Store and listed on the top ten in the three local radio channels. It also hit second in Top Ten Best Selling Albums of all City Marts in Yangon.

On 16 December 2017, Raymond performed a major duo concert "Reason To Be Idiots", alongside Aung La from Reason band, at Hmyawzinkyun.

    Featured by Kyar Pauk, Han Nay Tar and Novem Htoo, a popular song "Headshot" was his last work. The song highlights the bullies of Myanmar military and the courageous protests of the people. On 27 August 2015, he became a brand ambassador of Tuborg Myanmar.
    
    Throughout his music career, Raymond released two albums as a collaboration with Idiots, many singles and wrote several popular songs.</p>
